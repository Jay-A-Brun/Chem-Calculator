Question:

Why are some of the periodic table data kinda inconsistent in terms of kind of data? E.g:

"H": {
      "name": "Hydrogen",
      "mass": 1.00794,
      "number": 1,
      "oxidation_states": ["+1", "-1"],
      "e_config": [1],
      "ionization_energy": 1312,
      "electronegativity": 2.2,
      "melting_point": 14,
      "boiling_point": 20,
      "density": 0.000082,
      "radius": 32
    },
    "He": {
      "name": "Helium",
      "mass": 4.002602,
      "number": 2,
      "oxidation_states": [],
      "e_config": [2]

No He Radius, density, you get the idea. Ik you had GPT do it, but is there any specific reason?
